## 📘 Abstract
<details open>
<summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

This repository presents **SNP-Universal-Embedding**, a 6-dimensional reasoning embedding derived from the **Substrate–Prism Neuron (SNP)** architecture — forming the first measurable and testable model for **emotional reasoning and decision conflict** in AI.

Where the original paper introduced the theoretical foundation for multi-path reasoning and emotional contradiction, this sequel demonstrates **quantitative validation** through comparative embedding geometry and reasoning space analysis.

Key findings:
- The SNP embedding demonstrates superior **Reasoning Divergence Index (RDI)** and lower semantic variance compared to baseline models (OpenAI, SBERT, Cohere, Google).
- SNP exhibits **conceptual consistency across permutations**, **moral conflict separation**, and **structural reasoning retrieval** — proving it encodes *meaning*, not syntax.

## 🧪 Experimental Validation

<details open>
<summary><b>1️⃣ Embedding Cosine Similarity Matrix</b></summary>

Shows pairwise reasoning similarity between SNP and major baseline embeddings.  
Low cross-similarity with other models (≈0) demonstrates independence of reasoning logic.

<summary><b>2️⃣ PCA Projection — Reasoning Clustering</b></summary>

Distinct separation of SNP embeddings in PCA space highlights reasoning differentiation rather than linguistic correlation.

<details open>
<summary><b>3️⃣ Centroid Distance & Semantic Variance</b></summary>

Quantifies reasoning-space separation and semantic compactness.  
SNP forms a *reasoning nucleus* — high separation (Δμ) with lowest intra-cluster variance (σ²).

| Metric | SNP | OpenAI | SBERT | Cohere | Google |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Variance (σ²)** | **800.63** | 8478.68 | 9493.17 | 10690.78 | 10066.02 |

<summary><b>4️⃣ Reasoning Divergence Index (RDI)</b></summary>

SNP shows a **10× higher RDI** compared to all semantic models — proving it forms a reasoning vector space distinct from language embeddings.

| Model | RDI |
|--------|------|
| **SNP** | **0.04888** |
| OpenAI | 0.00461 |
| SBERT | 0.00412 |
| Cohere | 0.00366 |
| Google | 0.00389 |

<summary><b>5️⃣ Cognitive–Emotional Geometry Radar</b></summary>

The dual radar plots visualize the SNP’s balance between reasoning divergence, semantic tightness, and emotional coherence.

- **Cognitive Radar:** Reasoning divergence vs semantic tightness  
- **Emotional Radar:** Adds affect coherence (ΔAffect)

## 🧩 Validation Tests

| Test | Objective | Outcome |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Permutation Invariance** | Determines whether reordering words alters conceptual meaning | ✅ SNP maintained >0.98 similarity between all sentence permutations |
| **Conflict Opposition (Mirror Logic)** | Tests recognition of emotional/moral opposites (stay vs leave) | ✅ SNP achieved >90% triplet satisfaction, outperforming all baselines |
| **Structural Retrieval (Prism Logic)** | Evaluates ability to find events with identical reasoning structure | ✅ SNP retrieved 5/5 structural matches across reasoning frames |

## 🧠 Discussion
<details open>
<summary><b>Interpretation</b></summary>

- **High RDI (0.04888)** → Demonstrates reasoning uniqueness and emotional depth.  
- **Low variance (σ²=800.63)** → Indicates tight semantic control despite emotional generalization.  
- **Distinct PCA cluster** → Confirms a geometric divergence from language models toward a *reasoning domain*.  
- The SNP embedding successfully bridges cognitive and affective dimensions, forming the **core of Emotional AI reasoning**.
