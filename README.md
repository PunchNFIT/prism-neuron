*A Substrate-Prism Neuron Architecture for Modeling Emotional Conflict in AI*

This repository contains the paper, diagrams, and visuals supporting the novel theory of the Substrate-Prism Neuron — a new cognitive framework for modeling emotional reasoning in large language models (LLMs).

## 🧠 Abstract

Traditional neural architectures excel at statistical pattern recognition but lack the capacity to simulate complex emotional dilemmas like love, betrayal, and internal contradiction. This work introduces a two-path reasoning architecture — impulse and substrate — fused by recursive median logic and influenced by memory, motivation, and emotional context.
